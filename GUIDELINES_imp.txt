x = snr 
y corr 
dost n dcst both 
values note karne ke liye yeah karo - 
fir dono ko ek saath plot karo

prposed scheme 
embedding sys 
which noise - WHite gaussian noise
description of that noise
then extraction
performance measure 
corr and coeff

why compression to be done 

read the tutorial of dost --- read dost2_tutorial.txt

maths of dost ---- read dost2.txt
