SVD is a context of data analytics , dimensional reduaction and satellite data and image processing .
factorization of a into 3 mat ---  2 orthogonal and one diagonal
A = UD(V^t)

columns of U the left singular vectors
columns of V the right singular vectors
diagonals elements of D the  singular values of matrix A

to establish the decomposition first multiply 
AV = DU
by taking the transpose of Eq1 again we get yet another
At = V(D^t)(U^t)

and then multiply from the right to U to obtain 
A^tU = VD^t
